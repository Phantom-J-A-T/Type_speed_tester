[PHYSICS] EASY: Newton’s First Law of Motion: A body remains at rest or
in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force. Hooke’s Law:
The extension of a spring is directly proportional to the force applied.

reflection.

reaction. Universal Gravitation: Force is proportional to product of
masses and inversely proportional to square of distance. Kirchhoff’s
Voltage Law: Sum of voltages in a loop is zero.

[CHEMISTRY] EASY: Law of Conservation of Mass: Matter cannot be created
or destroyed. Dalton’s Theory: All matter is made of atoms. Boyle’s Law:
Pressure is inversely proportional to volume.

MEDIUM: Charles’ Law: Volume is proportional to temperature. Avogadro’s
Law: Equal volumes of gases contain equal molecules. Periodic Law:
Properties vary periodically with atomic number.

HARD: Le Chatelier’s Principle: System shifts to oppose change. Graham’s
Law: Diffusion rate inversely proportional to square root of density.
Hess’s Law: Total enthalpy change is independent of path.

[BIOLOGY] EASY: Cell Theory: All living things are made of cells. Law of
Dominance: Dominant traits mask recessive traits. Use and Disuse: Used
organs develop, unused weaken.

MEDIUM: Segregation Law: Alleles separate during gamete formation.
Natural Selection: Fittest organisms survive and reproduce. Homeostasis:
Regulation of stable internal conditions.

HARD: Independent Assortment: Genes assort independently. Hardy–Weinberg
Principle: Allele frequencies remain constant without external forces.
Binomial Nomenclature: Organisms have two-part scientific names.

[ECONOMICS] EASY: Law of Demand: Higher price, lower quantity demanded.
Law of Supply: Higher price, higher quantity supplied. Diminishing
Utility: Extra satisfaction decreases with each additional unit.

MEDIUM: Diminishing Returns: Output eventually decreases with more
input. Equilibrium Law: Supply equals demand at equilibrium. Engel’s
Law: Food spending ratio decreases as income rises.

HARD: Gresham’s Law: Bad money drives out good money. Say’s Law: Supply
creates its own demand. Comparative Advantage: Specialization based on
lower opportunity cost.

[GEOGRAPHY] EASY: Superposition Law: Older rock layers lie beneath
younger ones. Continental Drift: Continents slowly move apart.
Hydrological Cycle: Water circulates through evaporation and
precipitation.

MEDIUM: Plate Tectonics: Earth’s crustal plates move slowly. Coriolis
Effect: Deflection of wind due to Earth’s rotation. River Maturity Law:
Rivers evolve through stages.

HARD: Uniformitarianism: Current geological processes operated in the
past. Thermal Expansion: Rocks expand when heated and crack when cooled.
Lapse Rate Law: Temperature decreases with altitude.

[MATHEMATICS] EASY: Pythagoras’ Theorem: a² + b² = c² in right
triangles. Commutative Law: a + b = b + a. Associative Law: (a + b) + c
= a + (b + c).

MEDIUM: Quadratic Formula: Solutions of ax² + bx + c = 0. Sine Rule:
a/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C). Cosine Rule: c² = a² + b² − 2ab cos(C).

HARD: Binomial Theorem: Expands expressions of form (a + b)^n. Limit
Definition: Limit as x approaches a of f(x). Vector Dot Product: a·b =
|a||b|cosθ.

problem. Input/Output Law: Computers process input to produce output.
Binary System: Data represented in 0s and 1s.

MEDIUM: Boolean Logic: Operations use AND, OR, NOT. Machine Language:
Lowest-level programming instructions. Data Structure: Organized way of
storing data.

HARD: Big O Notation: Measures algorithm efficiency. CPU Scheduling:
Determines order of process execution. Memory Management: Allocation and
control of system memory.
